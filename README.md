ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @willianrbarbosa

I'm passionate about software development, I chose this profession ten years ago, without knowing exactly how it works, and I fell in love, mainly with full-stack web development.
I love to use the power of technology to give to the user the ability to improve the process, optimize and speed up their daily activities, and I'm crazy about UX.

My skills include complex analysis, mapping requirement specifications, understanding the real process and turn it into a very good software.

** CORE COMPETENCIES AND SPECIALTIES **
â€¢ 10 years of diverse Software Development and Management experience
â€¢ Bachelor's Degree in Information Systems
â€¢ Technical course in IT
â€¢ Cross-Functional Experience in Software Engineering, Software Development, Managment teams, Cloud Computing.
â€¢ Good relationship skills with users (I like to think that they are one of the main parts of the software development process).

I'm specilist in full stack web development, after years working with PHP and Angular, I decided to change to NodeJS and React in 2020.
Iâ€™m learning everyday, everything has something to tech us.
